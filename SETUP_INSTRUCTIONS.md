# Setup Instructions for Branch Protection

This repository has been prepared with comprehensive branch protection documentation and automated CI/CD workflows.

## What Was Added

### 1. Documentation Files

#### Main Documentation
- **BRANCH_PROTECTION.md** - Comprehensive guide explaining:
  - Why branch protection is important
  - Protection against force pushes
  - Protection against branch deletion
  - Required status checks before merging
  - Additional recommended settings

#### Quick Setup Guide
- **.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md** - Step-by-step instructions for:
  - Navigating to GitHub settings
  - Configuring each protection rule
  - Testing the setup
  - Troubleshooting common issues

#### Configuration Reference
- **.github/branch-protection-config.json** - JSON reference showing recommended settings
- **.github/README.md** - Documentation of GitHub-specific configurations

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

Two automated workflows are now configured:

#### Build and Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`)
- Runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`
- Installs Qt5 dependencies
- Builds with both Make and CMake
- Verifies build succeeds
- Provides `build` status check

#### Code Quality Workflow (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`)
- Runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`
- Checks for required files
- Validates repository structure
- Performs basic quality checks
- Provides `check-files` status check

### 3. Additional Files

- **.gitignore** - Excludes build artifacts and temporary files
- **README.md** (updated) - Added "Contributing" section with link to branch protection docs

## Next Steps (Action Required)

### Step 1: Enable Branch Protection (Administrator Only)

You need to manually configure branch protection rules through the GitHub web interface:

1. **Go to Settings**: https://github.com/PrashunKC/8085_emulation/settings/branches

2. **Add Branch Protection Rule**: Click "Add branch protection rule"

3. **Configure for `main` branch**:
   - Branch name pattern: `main`
   
4. **Enable These Settings**:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging (with 1 approval)
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   - ‚úÖ **Do not allow force pushes** (CRITICAL)
   - ‚úÖ **Do not allow deletions** (CRITICAL)

5. **Save**: Click "Create" or "Save changes"

> **Detailed Instructions**: See [.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)

### Step 2: Wait for First Workflow Run

After creating a pull request or pushing to main:
1. GitHub Actions will run automatically
2. Check the "Actions" tab to see workflow results
3. Status checks will appear in pull requests

### Step 3: Enable Status Checks (After First Run)

Once workflows have run at least once:
1. Go back to branch protection settings
2. Under "Require status checks to pass before merging"
3. Select these status checks:
   - `build`
   - `check-files`

### Step 4: Test the Protection

Create a test branch and verify:
```bash
# Try to force push (should fail)
git push --force origin main

# Try to delete main (should fail)
git push origin --delete main

# Create a PR (should require status checks and approval)
git checkout -b test-protection
echo "test" >> README.md
git commit -am "Test"
git push origin test-protection
```

## Key Features of This Setup

### Protection Against Data Loss
- ‚ùå **Force pushes blocked** - Git history cannot be rewritten
- ‚ùå **Branch deletion blocked** - Main branch cannot be deleted accidentally

### Code Quality Assurance
- ‚úÖ **Automated builds** - Code must compile before merging
- ‚úÖ **Quality checks** - Basic validation runs automatically
- ‚úÖ **Pull request required** - No direct pushes to main
- ‚úÖ **Review required** - At least 1 approval needed

### Process Enforcement
- All conversations must be resolved
- Branches must be up to date before merge
- Rules apply to everyone (including admins)
