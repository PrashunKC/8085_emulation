### Undefined Opcodes: 10

These opcodes are **illegal/undefined** in the 8085 and are handled as NOP:

| Opcode | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| 0x08 | Undefined - treated as NOP |

| 0x28 | Undefined - treated as NOP |
| 0x38 | Undefined - treated as NOP |
| 0xCB | Undefined - treated as NOP |
| 0xD9 | RET in 8080, but undefined in 8085 |
| 0xDD | Undefined - treated as NOP |
| 0xED | Undefined - treated as NOP |
| 0xFD | Undefined - treated as NOP |

## Testing Recommendations

To test the emulator thoroughly:
1. Test basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB, INR, DCR)
2. Test logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)
3. Test jumps and calls
4. Test conditional branches
5. Test stack operations
6. Test register pair operations
7. Test memory operations
8. Test all addressing modes
